# Scylla
This is one of my earliest programs developed when I was relatively new to Java in 2015. 
I developed it to store passwords and other secret information (for just myself).
Looking back at the code, I can't help but laugh at myself. There were so many things I didn't know back then.
I am however proud of it because it contributed to my growth in programming.

You can easily build it to see how it works or checkout the screenshots I have included in the root directory.

# Tools Used
Java SE7 - Swing, AWT, JDBC, Derby,
SQL,
Photoshop (For designing my splashscreen and about images)
